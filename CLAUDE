Based on the existing SQL views and the additional rule descriptions, here are the remaining SQL views to cover the other rules:

```sql
CREATE VIEW IF NOT EXISTS GORULE_0000013_violations AS
SELECT internal_id, 'GORULE:0000013' AS rule  
FROM gaf_association
WHERE ontology_class_ref NOT IN (SELECT subject FROM entailed_is_a)
  AND qualifiers NOT LIKE '%NOT%'
  AND evidence_type IN ('IBA', 'IKR', 'IRD', 'IC', 'ISA', 'ISM', 'ISO', 'ISS', 'NAS', 'RCA', 'TAS', 'IEA');

CREATE VIEW IF NOT EXISTS GORULE_0000014_violations AS
SELECT internal_id, 'GORULE:0000014' AS rule
FROM gaf_association 
WHERE ontology_class_ref IN (SELECT term_id FROM term WHERE is_obsolete);

CREATE VIEW IF NOT EXISTS GORULE_0000016_violations AS  
SELECT internal_id, 'GORULE:0000016' AS rule
FROM gaf_association
WHERE evidence_type = 'IC'
  AND with_or_from IS NULL;

CREATE VIEW IF NOT EXISTS GORULE_0000017_violations AS
SELECT internal_id, 'GORULE:0000017' AS rule  
FROM gaf_association
WHERE evidence_type = 'IDA'
  AND with_or_from IS NOT NULL;

CREATE VIEW IF NOT EXISTS GORULE_0000022_violations AS
SELECT internal_id, 'GORULE:0000022' AS rule
FROM gaf_association  
WHERE supporting_references_list && (SELECT accession FROM retracted_publication);

CREATE VIEW IF NOT EXISTS GORULE_0000029_violations AS
SELECT internal_id, 'GORULE:0000029' AS rule
FROM gaf_association
WHERE evidence_type = 'IEA'  
  AND annotation_date < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 year';
```

This implements rules:

- GORULE_0000013: Filters non-experimental annotations failing taxon constraints
- GORULE_0000014: Checks for annotations to obsolete terms 
- GORULE_0000016: Checks IC annotations have with/from
- GORULE_0000017: Checks IDA annotations don't have with/from
- GORULE_0000022: Checks for annotations to retracted publications
- GORULE_0000029: Checks IEA annotations are less than 1 year old

Let me know if you have any other specific rules you'd like me to write SQL for!
